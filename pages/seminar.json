		{
			"question": "Can I share a project I've been working on?",
			"answer": "Yes! Seminar works best when everyone shares their projects and interests. To ensure a slot to share, please contact the group on <a href='https://matrix.to/#/!oClBfIbtucPfGKlNpk:matrix.parity.io'>Riot</a>."
		},
		{
			"question": "I am not a [Substrate] developer, can I still participate?",
			"answer": "Yes! The seminar is open to everyone. The content is generally more developer-oriented, but less technical participants and questions are also welcome. If your questions turn out to be off-topic, we'll point you to a better resource."
		},
		{
			"question": "Is this related to Substrate Collaborative Learning?",
			"answer": "Yes! Substrate Collaborative Learning was the previous harder-to-pronounce iteration of Substrate Seminar. When we decided to start meeting every week, and have a more discoverable web presence, we rebranded. If you liked Substrate Collaborative Learning, you'll love Substrate Seminar. The <a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp0_ueXY_enUCPszf_3Q9ZxovLvKm1eMx'>SCL recordings</a> are still available."
